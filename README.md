# TCP-Client-Lab

## Objective

The TCP Client project aimed to provide a lightweight and versatile software application designed to facilitate communication between client devices and remote servers using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This tool aims to offer a user-friendly interface for establishing TCP connections, sending and receiving data packets, and interacting with network services hosted on remote servers. Whether used for network diagnostics, protocol testing, or custom application development, the TCP client tool prioritizes reliability, efficiency, and ease of use, enabling users to seamlessly navigate the complexities of TCP-based communication while addressing their specific networking requirements.
